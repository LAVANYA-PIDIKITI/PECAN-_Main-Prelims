# The eXORcist
XOR or Exclusive OR is one of the most simplistic, yet practical logical functions used for bitwise operations. XOR encryption is a type of symmetrical encryption that uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the messages.

The flag for this challenge is hidden in the encrypted string present in the file: encryptedXOR.txt Run the XOR operation against the above cypher text once you have found the key.
