# Lost in substitution
A simple substitution cipher works by choosing a random letter to encrypt each letter of the alphabet. Each letter is used once and only once. Therefore, the key will be a string of 26 letters of the alphabet in random order.

Try and break the cipher text present in the encrypted.txt file. The flag can be found by decrypting the substitution cipher text first.

The flag is the last line of the quote in decrypted text. Remember to replace the spaces with _.
